# FdF (Fil de Fer) - 3D Wireframe Viewer

## About The Project

FdF (Fil de Fer) is a 3D wireframe viewer developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. The program takes a map file as input and renders it as a 3D wireframe representation, allowing users to visualize terrain and geometric shapes in a three-dimensional space.

## Features

- 3D wireframe rendering
- Various map file support
- Color gradient support
- Rotation and zoom controls
- Interactive camera movement
- Isometric and parallel projection views

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Ertugrul-Pakdamar/42_ring2_fdf.git
cd 42_ring2_fdf

# Compile the project
make
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
./fdf test_maps/42.fdf

# Using with other map files
./fdf test_maps/[map_file_name].fdf
```

### Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the map
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **R Key**: Reset view
- **ESC**: Exit program

## Map File Format

The program reads map files with the following format:
```
0  0  0  0  0
0  1  2  3  0
0  2  4  6  0
0  3  6  9  0
0  0  0  0  0
```

Each number represents a point in 3D space:
- Position in the grid (x,y)
- Altitude (z)

## Dependencies

- MinilibX
- Math Library
- X11 Library
